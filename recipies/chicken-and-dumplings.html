    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Doesn't that picture just <em>scream</em> cozy? This southern-inspired <strong>chicken and dumplings</strong>
        recipe will leave your family speechless! This recipe is made from scratch and uses techniques to ensure the
        juiciest chicken, most flavorful homemade soup, and airy, fluffy dumplings that steam to perfection.</p>

    <p>Chicken and Dumplings start with a savory chicken soup with vegetables in a creamy broth. The soup is topped with
        uncooked dumplings that are then steamed on top. It's a popular comfort food in the Southern US, and can vary in

        <li>1/4 cup of cold milk</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of butter, <em>melted</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Sear the chicken</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season each side of the chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a 4 ½-quart soup pot over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and cook for 3 minutes per side, until a little bit of a brown color has developed. The
            middle will still be uncooked.</li>
        <li>Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes, then dice into bite-sized pieces.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make the Soup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the seasonings and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the same pot over medium heat and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom of the
            pot.</li>
        <li>Add the diced onions, carrots, and celery and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and seasonings. Cook for 1 more minute.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and toss to coat. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring continuously.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth in small splashes, stirring continuously. Scrape up any remnants from the bottom of
            the pot as you do so.</li>
        <li>Add the half and half in the same manner.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken bouillon, if using.</li>
        <li>Add frozen peas.</li>
        <li>Bring to a gentle boil and let it simmer, uncovered, while you make the dumplings.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Make the Dumplings</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, garlic powder, and sugar in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the milk, sour cream, and melted butter. Use a folding motion to combine and form a dough, but
            don't overmix or they will be dense.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken back to the soup along with any juices from the plate. Stir to combine and reduce heat to
            low.</li>
        <li><em>(If using leftover chicken, add it now.)</em></li>
        <li>Use a small cookie scoop and carefully place the dumplings over the soup in an even layer. Spoon a little
            liquid over each one.</li>
        <li>Cover tightly and increase heat slightly to bring it to a gentle simmer. Set a timer for 15 minutes, don’t
            lift the lid during this time, the dumplings need to steam.</li>
        <li>Open the lid and insert a toothpick into the middle of a dumpling to check for doneness. If it comes out
            clean, it’s ready. If not, cover and simmer for a few more minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the middle is set, garnish with parsley and serve!</li>
    </ol>
