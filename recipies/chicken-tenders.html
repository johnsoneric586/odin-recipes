    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe uses a buttermilk marinade to infuse the chicken with both flavor and moisture, while a breading of
        panko and parmesan cheese is blasted to golden and crispy perfection in the air fryer.</p>

    <p>Air fryer chicken tenders are our latest family-friendly, easy-to-get-on-the-table dinner <em>obsession.</em></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lb. chicken tenders</li>
        <li>1 c. buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tsp. seasoned salt, divided</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp. black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 c. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 c. panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 c. freshly grated parmesan cheese (or 1/4 cup pre-grated parmesan cheese)</li>
        <li>Cooking spray, such as Pam Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Honey mustard, BBQ sauce, and/or ranch dressing, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> In a zip-top plastic bag, combine the chicken tenders, buttermilk, 1 teaspoon of seasoned salt and ½
            teaspoon of black pepper. Seal and massage the buttermilk mixture into the tenders. Let marinate for 30
            minutes, or up to 2 hours, in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place the flour on a small plate. In a wide shallow bowl, whisk together the two eggs. In another
            wide, shallow bowl, combine the panko, parmesan cheese, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of seasoned salt and 1/4
            teaspoon of black pepper.</li>
        <li>Using a pair of tongs, remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade (reserve the marinade) and place the
            chicken in a single layer on a paper-towel lined plate. Pour the remaining buttermilk marinade into the bowl
            with the eggs and whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Working 2-3 tenders at a time, dredge all over in the flour, dip in the egg mixture to coat completely, then
            dredge to coat completely in the panko breadcrumb mixture. Repeat until all of the tenders are breaded.
            Spray all over both sides of each tender with cooking spray (olive oil spray gives great flavor!)</li>
        <li>Working in two batches, place the tenders in a single layer, with about a half inch of space between them.
            Cook in the air fryer set at 380°F for 8 minutes. Then flip and continue to cook for 4-6 minutes longer,
            until the internal temperature of the chicken reads 165°F. Repeat with the second batch of tenders. Serve
            immediately alongside dipping sauces such as honey mustard, BBQ sauce, and/or ranch dressing.</li>
    </ol>
