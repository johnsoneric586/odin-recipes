    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Skip the cold cuts this year and wow your Super Bowl crowd with the ultimate meatball sub.</p>

    <p>The meatballs - a classic beef and pork mix with parmesan cheese and garlic—would make any Italian grandmother
        proud. (Just don't tell her that jarred marinara is standing in for homemade!)</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Meatballs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 c. breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 c. freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 c. flat leaf parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp. ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 c. milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 lb. ground beef (80/20)</li>
        <li>1 lb. ground pork</li>
        <li>1/4 c. olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Subs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 c. marinara sauce</li>
        <li>6 hoagie rolls, about 8-inches long</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>24 meatballs</li>
        <li>6 slices provolone cheese, halved</li>
        <li>1/3 c. parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 c. chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the meatballs: Stir together the breadcrumbs, parmesan, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper in a large
            mixing bowl. Stir in milk and eggs until mixture is a loose, <em>paste-like consistency.</em></li>
        <li>Add beef and pork. Using your hand like a claw in a twisting motion, gently mix the meat with the breadcrumb
            mixture until well combined.</li>
        <li>Divide the meat mixture into 2 ounce portions and gently shape into balls about 2 inches wide. (If the
            mixture is sticking to your hands, lightly grease your hands with olive oil to prevent sticking.)</li>
        <li>Heat a large Dutch oven over medium heat; add the olive oil. Working in batches of 6 to 8, brown the
            meatballs on all sides, about 1 minute per side, turning each meatball about 4 times. Remove from the heat
            and drain the grease from the pot.</li>
        <li>Return the Dutch oven to low heat and add the marinara sauce.</li>
        <li>Nestle the meatballs into the pasta sauce without stirring. Cover and cook 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gently stir the meatballs, making sure each one is coated in sauce. Cover and cook 15 minutes more, or until
            the meatballs reach an internal temperature of 165°.</li>
        <li>For the sandwiches: Preheat oven to broil.</li>
        <li>Slices the hoagies rolls lengthwise, through the center of the rolls. Hollow out about 1 inch of the inside
            of the bread, from the bottom pieces of the rolls.</li>
        <li>Brush the insides of the bread with the olive oil and place, cut-side up, on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil
            until the bread is toasted, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the top halves of the hoagie rolls from the baking
            sheet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add 4 meatballs to each of the bottom halves of the rolls; top with 2 pieces of provolone cheese. Broil
            until the cheese is melted and browned, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add more sauce to each sandwich if desired. Sprinkle each sub with parmesan cheese and parsley. Top with the
            remaining hoagie roll halves. <strong>Serve immediately.</strong></li>
    </ol>
